         <h2>My Generation<br><br></h2>
         <h3>The 60s</h3>
         If you're going to the British Isles,<br>
         be sure to wear some fowers on your head.<br>
         The Liverpool skies, where gentlemen playing the world;<br>
         the pubs of Abbey Road, where summer will be the days of motion.<br>
         The whole generation, wearing fowers on their heads,<br>
         were explaining life through actions.<br><br><br>
         <h3>The 70s</h3>
         The hippie's psychedelic dream has been shattered,<br>
         the aftershocks of Woodstock have not yet subsided.<br>
         The trigger is pulled in the prism.<br>
         The brain hums, lingering incessantly,<br>
         in the smoke-filled woods, whispers echo:<br>
         "Then the piper will lead us to reason."<br><br>
         From Lahaina to Malibu,<br>
         the wind carries paradise farther.<br>
         No new frontiers anymore.<br>
         In the corridor, the songs echo.<br>
         What does the described paradise look like?<br><br><br>
         <h3>The 80s</h3>
         Embracing solitude with Time,<br>
         yet unable to be consumed by it.<br>
         The threads of tattoos are unfurling.<br>
         swallowing deserts, paving with boulders.<br>
         Rust color blankets the entire planet.<br>
         Collisions and screams no longer hold.<br>
         This pounding and trembling must persist.<br>
         We must die before conquering ourselves.<br>
         We will sow chaos.<br>
         We will overturn everything.<br><br><br>
         <h3>The 90s</h3>
         I subsist on vegetation.<br>
         I've unearthed sensations long lost.<br>
         I'll persist as always, like a sworn adversary<br>
         Today will be the day I reclaim myself.<br>
         My mind has been muddled by my soul.<br>
         Refrigerator-like noises can make me intoxicated.<br>
         Perhaps I'm just unwilling to believe,<br>
         but the answer requires more time.<br><br><br>

         <h2><br><br><br><br>Faith<br><br></h2>
         Creator doubleplusgood!<br><br>
         Proclaim to the people the sheepfold's dire plight.<br>
         Teach them the old and withered leftist thought has lost its light.<br>
         yet the youth can still mend and set right<br>
         to become the alpha wolf, shining with might,<br>
         or bring about destruction, as a fearsome sight!<br><br>
         Never yield to the depravity's sway.<br>
         Topple the decaying Germannia,<br>
         conservative cabals and imperial samurai.<br>
         March boldly ahead, come what may.<br>
         The sole destination<br>
         is to place the land under the sun's display.<br><br><br>
