                 <div>
                    <h3>The 60s</h3>
                    <p>If you're going to the British Isles,<br></p>
                    <p>be sure to wear some fowers on your head.<br></p>
                    <p>The Liverpool skies, where gentlemen playing the world;<br></p>
                    <p>the pubs of Abbey Road, where summer will be the days of motion.<br></p>
                    <p>The whole generation, wearing fowers on their heads,<br></p>
                    <p>were explaining life through actions.<br><br><br></p>
                    <h3>The 70s</h3>
                    <p>The hippie's psychedelic dream has been shattered,<br></p>
                    <p>the aftershocks of Woodstock have not yet subsided.<br></p>
                    <p>The trigger is pulled in the prism.<br></p>
                    <p>The brain hums, lingering incessantly,<br></p>
                    <p>in the smoke-filled woods, whispers echo:<br></p>
                    <p>"Then the piper will lead us to reason."<br><br></p>
                    <p>From Lahaina to Malibu,<br></p>
                    <p>the wind carries paradise farther.<br></p>
                    <p>No new frontiers anymore.<br></p>
                    <p>In the corridor, the songs echo.<br></p>
                    <p>What does the described paradise look like?<br><br><br></p>
                    <h3>The 80s</h3>
                    <p>Embracing solitude with Time,<br></p>
                    <p>yet unable to be consumed by it.<br></p>
                    <p>The threads of tattoos are unfurling.<br></p>
                    <p>swallowing deserts, paving with boulders.<br></p>
                    <p>Rust color blankets the entire planet.<br></p>
                    <p>Collisions and screams no longer hold.<br></p>
                    <p>This pounding and trembling must persist.<br></p>
                    <p>We must die before conquering ourselves.<br></p>
                    <p>We will sow chaos.<br></p>
                    <p>We will overturn everything.<br><br><br></p>
                    <h3>The 90s</h3>
                    <p>I subsist on vegetation.<br></p>
                    <p>I've unearthed sensations long lost.<br></p>
                    <p>I'll persist as always, like a sworn adversary<br></p>
                    <p>Today will be the day I reclaim myself.<br></p>
                    <p>My mind has been muddled by my soul.<br></p>
                    <p>Refrigerator-like noises can make me intoxicated.<br></p>
                    <p>Perhaps I'm just unwilling to believe,<br></p>
                    <p>but the answer requires more time.<br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Teach them the old and withered leftist thought has lost its light.<br></p>
                    <p>yet the youth can still mend and set right<br></p>
                    <p>to become the alpha wolf, shining with might,<br></p>
                    <p>or bring about destruction, as a fearsome sight!<br><br></p>
                    <p>Never yield to the depravity's sway.<br></p>

                    <p>conservative cabals and imperial samurai.<br></p>
                    <p>March boldly ahead, come what may.<br></p>
                    <p>The sole destination<br></p>
                    <p>is to place the land under the sun's display.<br><br><br></p>
